    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>We firmly believe that privacy is both inconsequential and unimportant to you. If it were not, you probably would not have a Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn account: and you certainly wouldn't ever use a search engine like Google. If you're one of those tin-foil-hat wearing crazies that actually cares about privacy: stop using our services and get a life.
        We agree with Mark Zuckerberg when he pithily opined "The age of Privacy is Over. Basically we took full responsiblity of sharing all your useless data and you will be abiding to it by signing up."</p>
