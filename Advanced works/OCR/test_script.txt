INTRODUCTION

Vol. I of the Caraka Samhita was released in November 1981 at the inau-
gural session of the world Sanskrit Conference held at Varanasi, It is after about a
year that vol. IT is coming out. During this period we were watching the response of
scholars and readers towards the sudden appearance of this new edition of the
Caraka Sambita. We are glad that it has been very heartening and encouraging
which prompted us to plan for further volumes of the great work. It is now contem-
plated, to prepare critical notes on the Samhita incorporating the views of main
commentators and discussing them threadbare so as to bring out definite conclusions
on various topics. As this would entail great deal of space and would practically
bean independent work, a separate vol. III has been planned for this which is expe-
cted to follow soon.

Importance of the latter half of the Caraka Samhita

Vol. II contains the last three sections ( Cikitsasthana, Kalpasthana and
Siddhisthna ) of the Samhita. Caraka Sambita is predominantly a text on thera-

tics-areq Fafefae’. It is pertinent too because Caraka Tepresents the school of
medicine and his work is the embodiment of doctrines and traditions of therapeutics
of this school. From this point of view, this volume is very important,

‘The Cikitsasthana (section on therapeutics ) contains thirty chapters out of
which the major portion (seventeen chapters) is ascribed to the authorship of Drdha-
bala. The other two sections ( Kalpasthana and Siddhisthana ) are entirely accre-
dited to Drdhabala. Thus historically too, this portion is important.

The Cikitsasthana begins with the chapters on Rasayana and Vajikarana
which indicates the priority of prevention and promotion over treatment of disorders,
‘The other peculiarity of these two chapters is that it is reminiscent of the ancient
style of dividing a chapter into four quarters (padas) as is seenin Papini’s astadhyayi
and Patanjalis mahabhasya. ) It is surprising that this style is seen in no other
